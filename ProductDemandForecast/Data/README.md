# Introduction

  The datasets provided here are simulated to mimic the type
  of data that a manufacurer or retailer might actually use. These simulated datasets allow
  the scripts to be run to replicate a real world process. A data
  scientist can replace these simulated datasets with their own data of
  the same form to initiate their forecasting.
