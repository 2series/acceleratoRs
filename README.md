# Introduction

**acceleratoRs** are a collection of R based lightweight data science solutions that offer quick start for data scientists to experiment, prototype, and present their data analytics of specific domain.

The accelerators in the repos are structured following the project template of the [Microsoft Team Data Science Process](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/learning-paths/data-science-process/), in a simplified and accelerator-friendly version. The analytics are scripted in R markdown (notebook), and can be used to conveniently yield outputs in various formats (ipynb, PDF, html, etc.).
